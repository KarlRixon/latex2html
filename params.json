The parser part is tackled by a flex script, and the Bison takes care of the conversion grammer.\r\n\r\n\r\n * The converter is successful for moderately complex LaTeX files. Highly intricate preambles may cause the program to fail. \r\n * Mathematical expressions have been tackled in the sense the greek alphabets are represented in their true form in the Html files, however, all Complex mathematical expressions may not be successfully converted. Grammer still needs work.\r\n * Standard latex Tables have been implemented, but there is a chance varied tabular depictions may fail. \r\n * All shift-reduce, reduce reduce conflicts could not be completely removed. Implementation works reasonably well for the LaTeX files of the type of example .tex file that has been included.\r\n\r\n>#####*Note: This was developed as a part of Second Year, First semester Compiler design course assignment Indian Statistical Institute (Kolkata). Course was taken by Prof. Mandar Mitra.*\r\n\r\n\r\n####Usage\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n```\r\nflex latex2html.l\r\nyacc -d -t latex2html.y\r\ngcc -o latex2html y.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can use the included **command.sh** shell script\r\n```\r\n$sh command.sh\r\n```\r\nThis will generate an object file named: **latex2html**\r\nIf for example we want to parse the example **.tex** file included we'll execute the following command\r\n```\r\n./latex2html sample-filename.html < turing.tex > log.txt\r\n```\r\nThe .tex file has to be included within left (<) and right (>) angular brackets, they are used as the redirecting operators.\r\n\r\nLog file will be useful for debugging, incase of errors, where exactly in the input *.tex* file the parsing had failed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
